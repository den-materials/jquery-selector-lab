# Make Your Own jQuery Selector

<!--This is REALLY FUCKING HARD for students.  We're having issues just with using dev tools to t-shoot, never mind the conditionals and function splitting. This time around, we should make sure they have a really solid grasp on general approach before moving into part one, and a really solid grasp on conditionals and functions before part two.-->

## Introduction

So by now, we know about the jQuery selector `$()`. Since jQuery is a Javascript library, the jQuery selector itself is built using Javascript.  Today, you will use Javascript to build your very own selector function that does the same thing as `$()`.

## Instructions

<!-- 11:50 15 minutes -->

### Part One

In squads, use a whiteboard to write one function that emulates the $ jQuery function using `document.getElementById()`, `document.getElementsByClassName()`, and `document.getElementsByTagName()`.  Have one person writing on the board, and one person suggesting tweaks.

After 5 minutes, switch roles, so the other person is writing.

<!--Ask devs how they will break up this problem -->

<!--12:05 25 minutes -->

### Part Two

In squads, translate the whiteboarding results to code.  Select one person to "drive", another person to "navigate", and at least one person to research.  After 10 minutes, switch roles.

You should *always* be able to test your coding changes. Test your JS code every time you change something, and check Developer Tools and/or your Terminal.

> Hint: What is the simplest webpage you could create with HTML that would allow you to test live with the browser?

### Part Three

When you are finished with your selector, create a button on your page that says `Transform`.  Use it to change the style of at least: 

- One ID
- Two classes
- Two tags

#### Bonus

Use animations or transitions with your `Transform` button.

### Part Three

As a class, discuss what you learned from this exercise:

- What was the hardest part?
- How does jQuery relate to Javascript?
- What are some mistakes you made that the class can learn from?
