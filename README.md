# Make Your Own jQuery Selector

## Introduction

So by now, we know about the jQuery selector `$()`. Since jQuery is a Javascript library, the jQuery selector itself is built using Javascript.  Today, you will use Javascript to build your very own selector function that does the same thing as `$()`.

## Instructions

<!-- 15 minutes -->

### Part One

In pairs, use a whiteboard to write one function that emulates the $ jQuery function using document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName(), etc.  Have one person writing on the board, and one person suggesting tweaks.

After 5 minutes, switch roles, so the other person is writing.

<!--Ask devs how they will break up this problem -->

<!--30 minutes -->

### Part Two

Individually, translate the whiteboarding results to code.

You should *always* be able to test your coding changes. Test your JS code every time you change something, and check Developer Tools and/or your Terminal.

> Hint: What is the simplest webpage you could create with HTML that would allow you to test live with the browser?

### Part Three

When you are finished with your selector, create a button on your page that says `Transform`.  Use it to change the style of at least: 

- One ID
- Two classes
- Two tags

#### Bonus

Use animations or transitions with your `Transform` button.

### Part Four

As a class, discuss what you learned from this exercise:

- What was the hardest part?
- How does jQuery relate to Javascript?
- What are some mistakes you made that the class can learn from?
